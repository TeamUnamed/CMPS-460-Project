To run this web application, please copy/move the entire "SQLProject" directory to the "www" root.

Once a PHP and MySQL server are initialized, any access to the website that would result in a query will generate the
database and tables.

If that fails, table schema can be found in "constants.php" as well as constants dictating the SERVER, USERNAME,
PASSWORD, and DATABASE for SQL queries.
